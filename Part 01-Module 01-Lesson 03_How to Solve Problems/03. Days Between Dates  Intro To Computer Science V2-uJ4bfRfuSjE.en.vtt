00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
The problem that we'll use for this lesson,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.335
was one that was suggested by one of our students by Mathias Watson from Sweden.

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.285
Here's how he state the problem.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.610
This is days old number two and it says,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.170
"Given your birthday and the current date,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.015
calculate your age in days."

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.025
You have to be aware about leap days,

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:18.780
dates are complicated things.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.235
You can assume that, the inputs are correct dates.

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.250
Then there's an example here to say that,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130
"Well, if you were born on January 1st,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.280
2012 and today is January 2nd,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.600
2012, you're one day old.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.295
So, this is a great practice problem.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.260
Thanks Matthias for suggesting it,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.290
and it's generated lots of discussion on the forums.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.180
So, I wanted to step through how I would solve this problem.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.845
If you have not tried it yourself,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.840
I would strongly encourage you to do so.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.755
There's a link to the problem in the additional homework to try it yourself.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.540
I suggest keeping notes on how you solve it.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.770
Whether you're able to solve it or not,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.885
I hope you'll come back and watch the rest of this lesson.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:53.810
If you got stuck, this lesson will give you some ideas of how to get unstuck.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.520
Then, when you get unstuck, go back to trying to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.920
solve it on your own before continuing with the lesson.
