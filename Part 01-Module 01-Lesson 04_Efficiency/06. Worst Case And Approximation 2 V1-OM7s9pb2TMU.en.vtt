00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
If you notice before,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.290
I said you'll need at least 26 checks to get through every letter of the alphabet.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.884
In reality, it's unlikely that you'll have to go through all 26 letters each time.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.879
When we are discussing efficiency,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
we often talk about it in terms of the worst-case scenario,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.929
where we would have to check all 26 letters each time.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.795
We focus on worst case because it puts an

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.020
upper bound on the amount of time our code is going to take.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.585
You could also talk about efficiency in terms of the average case or even best case.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.530
So if we're talking about letters in the alphabet,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.924
the worst case means we would have to go through all 26 letters.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.489
However, the best case would be that we

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.145
find what we're looking for on the very first try.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:50.830
But on average, we're going to fall somewhere in the middle around 13.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.710
In a perfect world,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.725
iterating through a list of letters is going to take an average of 13 times.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.375
Sometimes, it'll be a little more.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:00.859
Sometimes, it'll be a little less,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.424
but it's fair to say it'll be about 13.

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:07.069
If we're going to try and calculate the average case efficiency,

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.109
it's going to look a little more like this.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.799
In the end, we'll get 16n plus two.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.554
Now, let's go back to our point about approximations.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:21.515
If we consider the average case the worst case or the best case,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:26.165
it's also going to result in O of n. In an interview,

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:29.525
you might be tempted to combine the average case,

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.520
the worst case, the best case,

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.844
and just give an answer like this.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.769
However, the best case, the worst case,

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:40.280
and the average case might not always approximate this nicely

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.810
so you really should specify to your interviewer which case you're talking about.
