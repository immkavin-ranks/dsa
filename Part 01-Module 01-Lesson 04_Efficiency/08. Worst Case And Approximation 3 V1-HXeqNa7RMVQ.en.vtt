00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899
We've been talking a lot about time efficiency.

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.455
But you can actually use the same notation to refer to space efficiency too.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.620
For example, let's say you needed to copy over

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.084
your input string three times in your code for some reason.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.580
Then the space efficiency would look something like this.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.539
Space efficiency is asked less frequently in interviews but

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.049
it's definitely something you should consider because it will come up from time to time.
