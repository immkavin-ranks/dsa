00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Since the amount of steps can vary widely based on the specific implementations,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.710
we normally use approximations when talking about efficiency in Big O notation.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.020
Since the efficiency of the pseudocode we wrote before

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.309
could end up looking like any of these and even more,

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.964
we would say that the efficiency is actually

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:24.660
about big O of n. If you're running code for production,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.129
you definitely care about the number of computations and want to minimize it.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.105
However, in an interview,

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:34.295
your interviewer doesn't care that you can do that exactly,

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:36.590
but just wants to know that you are thinking about

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.360
efficiency and can calculate it if you need to.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.685
By approximating, we're really saying,

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:48.210
"Some number of computations must be performed for each letter in the input."
